# Can't run `git fetch origin main:main` if I'm on the main branch
# This isn't really a problem since the command is meant to be used when switching from a feature branch to `main`
# But as an extra convenience we run this before
git checkout --quiet -d HEAD

# Update the main branch before switching to it
# Assuming that the remote is called `origin`
git fetch origin main:main

git checkout main
